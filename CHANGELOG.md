# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- `<stepDef>` registrations are no longer lost when the pipeline resumes from a `<savepoint>`. Resuming skips all steps preceding the savepoint, which skipped the `<stepDef>` registration itself and made any later `<invoke>` fail with "no `<stepDef id="...">` has been registered". Steps implementing the new marker interface `ExecuteBeforeSavepointEvaluation` (currently `StepDefStep`) are now executed before savepoint evaluation and skipped by the main execution loop. Step hashes and savepoint validity are unaffected.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-09

## [1.6.2] - 2025-09-01
### Fixed
- Rename <shaclValidate>/<failForMissingInputGraph> to <shaclValidate>/<failOnMissingInputGraph>
- Add <shaclInfer>/<failForMissingInputGraph> parameter

## [1.6.1] - 2025-09-01
### Fixed
- Fixed <shaclValidate>/<failForMissingInputGraph>: correctly use 'true' as default value

## [1.6.0] - 2025-09-01
### Added
- New optional parameter <shaclValidate>/<failForMissingInputGraph> - allow input graphs to be empty in the pipeline dataset

### Fixed
- Improve formatting of validation report

## [1.5.5] - 2025-07-18
### Fixed
- filter validation results by `logSeverity` in `<shaclValidate>` console output

## [1.5.4] - 2025-07-16
### Fixed
- Copy namespace prefixes from all models in a dataset to a model when writing it in pipeline step <write>

## [1.5.3] - 2025-07-15
### Fixed
- fix ${project.basedir} being baked in at build time

## [1.5.2] - 2025-07-15
### Fixed
- fix decimal.pow() - return 0 for value 0 and negative exponent

## [1.5.1] - 2025-07-11
### Fixed
- fixed plugin.xml

## [1.5.0] - 2025-07-11
### Added
- a few custom sparql functions for decimals:
- division https://github.com/qudtlib/numericFunctions/decimal.div
- power https://github.com/qudtlib/numericFunctions/decimal.pow
- precision https://github.com/qudtlib/numericFunctions/decimal.precision
- roundToPrecision https://github.com/qudtlib/numericFunctions/decimal.roundToPrecision
- <when> step
- <stop> step

### Changed
- changed the URI prefix for resources used in pipeline metadata to https://github.com/qudtlib/rdfio/
- <clear> now supports <message>, <graphs> and <graph> subelements to support clearing specified graphs, not the whole dataset

## [1.4.5] - 2025-07-09
### Added
- Add `<message>` to `<write>` step

## [1.4.4] - 2025-07-08
### Fixed
- `<add>` multiple files to default graph no longer dies
- step hash now includes file content for InputsComponent (if filenames/paths don't contain variables, which are only known at pipeline execution time)

###

## [1.4.3] - 2025-06-30
### Fixed
- Filename handling in metadata graph of pipeline mojo

## [1.4.2] - 2025-06-24
### Added

## [1.4.1] - 2025-06-23

## [1.4.0] - 2025-06-23

## [1.3.1] - 2025-02-25

## [1.3.0] - 2025-02-15
### Added
- Add `<sparqlUpdateFile>` filter so the sparql udpate query can be read from a project file
- Add `<sparqlConstruct>` filter so a sparql construct query can be used to generate additional triples
